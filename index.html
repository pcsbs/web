      Web is a computer programming system created by Donald E. Knuth as the
      first implementation of what he called "literate programming": the idea
      that one could create software as works of literature, by embedding source
      code inside descriptive text, rather than the reverse (as is common
      practice in most programming languages), in an order that is convenient
      for exposition to human readers, rather than in the order demanded by the
      compiler.
